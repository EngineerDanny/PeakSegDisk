C++ code writes number of bedGraph lines to loss file.

problem.PeakSegFPOP outputs two data.tables rather than three (timings

Forked from PeakSegPipeline.

problem.PeakSegFPOP: before was checking start/end pos in segments
file with start/end pos in directory name. Now checking first/last
line in coverage.bedGraph. No longer import namedCapture.
